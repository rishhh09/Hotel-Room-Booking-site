# Hotel Booking Backend Implementation Guide

## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1 Environment Configuration
Setting up the environment correctly ensures your application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production). This involves creating configuration files that store sensitive information securely.

**Environment Variables (`.env`)**
The `.env` file stores sensitive information like database credentials and JWT secrets. This approach prevents hardcoding sensitive data directly in your codebase, enhancing security. Key variables include:
- Database connection string
- JWT secret for authentication
- Application port number
- API keys for third-party services

**Package Configuration (`package.json`)**
This file defines your project dependencies and scripts. It serves as both documentation and a functional tool that allows npm to install the dependencies your project needs. Essential packages include:
- Express.js for the web server framework
- Mongoose for MongoDB integration
- jsonwebtoken for JWT authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- dotenv for environment variable management

**Version Control Configuration (`.gitignore`)**
The `.gitignore` file specifies which files should be excluded from version control. This typically includes:
- Node modules folder
- Environment variable files
- Log files
- Build directories

### 1.2 Application Structure Setup

**Server Entry Point (`server.js`)**
This is the main file that initializes your Express application, connects to the database, and sets up middleware. It brings together all components of your application and starts the server listening on the configured port.

**Database Configuration (`config/db.js`)**
This file establishes the connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose. It handles connection events (success, error, disconnection) and implements connection pooling for better performance.

**Application Configuration (`config/config.js`)**
This centralizes all application settings, importing from environment variables and providing default values where needed. This approach makes it easy to modify application behavior without changing code.

## 2. Database Models

## Implementation Sequence Recommendations

For a methodical and testable approach to building this system, follow this implementation sequence:

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Begin with project setup, database configuration, and basic server structure.

2. **Authentication System**: Implement user registration, login, and role-based access control.

3. **Room Management**: Create the room database model and basic CRUD operations.

4. **Booking Core**: Implement the fundamental booking creation and retrieval with availability checks.

5. **User Dashboard**: Develop the personal booking management area for users.

6. **Notification System**: Add the notification capabilities for booking events.

7. **Admin Panel**: Implement administrative controls and oversight.

8. **Payment Integration**: Add payment processing if required.

9. **Security Enhancements**: Strengthen input validation, error handling, and security measures.
